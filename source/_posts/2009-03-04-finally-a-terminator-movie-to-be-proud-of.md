Never before had I experience something as awe inspiring as the Terminator 2 film. The survival of human kind, to the rebelious nature of John Connor to unbelievable CGI. I even waited for the "so called doomsday T3 movie" on August 29, 1997 (the day of the machines take over). When nothing came out I lost hope and thought the T2 movie would be the last of the Terminator saga.<br /><h3>Then Came T3 the mistake</h3><br />In  2003 Terminator 3 was released. The first time I noticed the movie trailor I experienced a child like excitement and rushed to the movies theatures early for the first showing I could attend. The T3 movie was horrible. So horrible in fact I began to feel betrayed by the Terminator franchise. You revolutionize the movie industry by your amazing graphics, then you release this crap. James Cameron (the creator) must have thought he can pass on anything to make a buck with this one.<br /><h3>Terminator Salvation, the movie that can save the franchise</h3>In case you haven't seen it here is the trailor,<br /><div class="youtube-video"><object id="uvp_fop" width="400" height="327"><param value="http://l.yimg.com/cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/fop/embedflv/swf/fop.swf" name="movie"> <param value="id=12282404&amp;rd=eyc-off&amp;ympsc=&amp;postpanelEnable=1&amp;prepanelEnable=1&amp;infopanelEnable=1&amp;carouselEnable=0" name="flashVars"> <param value="transparent" name="wmode"> <embed flashvars="id=12282404&amp;rd=eyc-off&amp;ympsc=&amp;prepanelEnable=1&amp;infopanelEnable=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://l.yimg.com/cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/fop/embedflv/swf/fop.swf" allowscriptaccess="always" id="uvp_fop" width="400" height="327"></embed>   </object></div><br />If you are any type of action junkie I hope you're as excited as I am about this.<br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=67b1d87b-65a8-4770-af32-8f3dc3c73dd4" class="zemanta-pixie-img" /></div></div>
