2012 was rough for me personally. My free time involved working Â a side job and I was unsatisfied with my day job. I gained 30 pounds and smoked more cigarettes than I should of and we moved into another house (which may seem like a good thing but I hate moving and the house is smaller). I'm not the type of person who feels sorry for myself and rarely do you ever see me in a bad mood but I felt the negativity trying to take hold of me everyday because I didn't feel as though there was a way out. Then one lucky day in November I saw light at the end of the tunnel. I got a new job.

Not only did I get a new job, but I got a new job at a good company where I feel as though I can make a positive impact around positive people. The hardest part of my old job was the negative people (mostly).

<strong>My plans for 2013</strong>
<ul>
	<li>My biggest hurdle has been cigarettes. The thing is I love to smoke. I've used smoking as a crutch for many years and even though we've had some good and bad times for the sake of my family it's time for me to quit.</li>
	<li>I plan on focusing more on personal projects. Every project that I work on is one to make money. 2013 I plan on creating fun projects to give me a little break.</li>
	<li>My programming language of the year is Python. In 2012 I spent allot of time with PHP and frameworks, but i need to get back into learning a language a year.</li>
	<li>New car. I'm cheap. I spend thousands of dollars on computers and gadgets but never my car. This year I plan on buying a newer car.</li>
	<li>Exercise. I've let myself go. I plan onÂ exercisingÂ 30 minutes a day in the morning to start.</li>
	<li>Blog more. I let this blog go by theÂ waistÂ side because I was working so much. I plan on bloggingÂ at leastÂ one time per month.</li>

Well I'm excited about what's to come in 2013 vs the negative 2012 that I had.";s:10:"post_title";s:24:"What's in store for 2013";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:23:"whats-in-store-for-2013";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-11-08 02:37:22";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-11-08 02:37:22";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=293";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
