The smartphone has been done before. Badly. The iPhone gave us a window into the future, a future where a computer and touch combine into the Star Trek like future I've only imagined. The iPhone did something else that I could have never prepared for. A future of dumbing down my desktop OS. Where Windows tries to combine touch into a desktop, where Ubuntu is getting into mobile and the Mac is well the Mac.

As PC sales and Mac sales decline (not so much for the Mac) it's hard to imagine a future where the desktop/laptop of today won't be replaced by ipads with keyboards of tomorrow. This future scares me. I don't want to touch my computer screen. It's uncomfortable and I hate finger prints. I live for keyboard shortcuts and powerful programs such as Phpstorm and Photoshop.

While this future of touchdesktopphoneism isn't here yet there are a few bright lights at the end of the tunnel. I've been using Linux Mint off and on for about a year and liked it but the window tileing (aero snap on Windows) wasn't close to compiz on Ubuntu, but Cinnamon 2 and Linux Mint 16 has changed that. You see the main dudes (yes I said dudes) from the Mint team have said that their focus is on the desktop and will continue to stay that way.

All of the touchy phone/tablet crap needs to stay off my truck because it's only getting in the way.";s:10:"post_title";s:34:"My Trucks Are Turning Into Hybrids";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:22:"trucks-turning-hybrids";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-12-06 05:33:33";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-12-06 05:33:33";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=555";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
