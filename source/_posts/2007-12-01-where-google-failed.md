The other day my wife asked me if a brother and sister beagle can mate. After calling my wife sick and getting into a big debate over just because it's a dog doesn't mean it's okay for a brother and sister to bump uglies I decided to find the info she was looking for. (Alright, the thing was I didn't feel like sleeping on the couch)<br /><br />My first instinct was to search <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Google</span>. Here is what I found,<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=beagle+dogs+mating&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS243US243">beagle dogs mating</a><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS243US243&amp;q=boy+girl+beagle+dog+bumping+uglies+okay%3F&amp;btnG=Search">boy girl beagle dog bumping uglies okay?</a><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS243US243&amp;q=can+boy+and+girl+beagles+do+it&amp;btnG=Search">can boy and girl beagles do it</a><br /><br />......Of course there were more searches involved by I thought these were the best especially the can boy and girl beagles do it query, check out the first result....<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The complete Idiot's guide to Beagles.</span><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QnxE8XBPT48/R1HtbAHmz-I/AAAAAAAAAJM/an6AsFeaKVw/s1600-R/google+failed-beagle.bmp"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QnxE8XBPT48/R1HtbAHmz-I/AAAAAAAAAJM/bH3GE7UcsB0/s400/google+failed-beagle.bmp" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5139149697950601186" border="0" /></a><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Hmmm</span>. The first result had nothing to do with breeding beagles. Nor did the second, third and last result on the page. After spending 10 minutes searching and <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">receiving</span> the exact same results I decided to use Ask.com. Sure enough after searching for <span style="font-weight: bold;">can boy and girl beagles do it </span>in Ask.com<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QnxE8XBPT48/R1Hz1wHmz_I/AAAAAAAAAJU/T_QlJO-Wh4E/s1600-R/ask.com%27s+results-beagles.bmp"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QnxE8XBPT48/R1Hz1wHmz_I/AAAAAAAAAJU/H7hHnZL_7FI/s400/ask.com%27s+results-beagles.bmp" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5139156754581868530" border="0" /></a>The <a href="http://www.beaglesinperil.org.uk/breed.htm">fourth result</a> gave me what I needed. Sorry Google you lost this one, but we are still close friends.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">FYI. It's perfectly okay to mate boy and girl beagles (if you really care).</span>
