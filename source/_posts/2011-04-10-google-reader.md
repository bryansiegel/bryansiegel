I love Google reader. It's by far my favorite way of reading news in Tech, SEO and Web development. If you're unfamiliar with Google reader I highly recommend that give it a try. If you have a Google account all you need to do is sign into your account on Google.com and navigation to Google.com/reader. <br /><br /><h3>Here are my Google Reader Stats</h3><br />Google Reader has a nice function that displays your Google reader reading activities. Below is mine.<br />From your 222 subscriptions, over the last 30 days you read 10,947 items<br />Since May 23, 2007 you have read a total of 90,138 items.<br /><h3>Google Listen</h3><br />Google listen is a fantastic Podcast reader for Android.
