While I decided to take a day vs a longer period of time I felt as though my mini experiment was a success, but I'm far from finished. Last Saturday, I completely unplugged from the internet. When I embarked on this experiment my goal was to see if myÂ unhealthilyÂ consumptionÂ of information via the internet was impairing my ability to focus. I first got wind of thisÂ possibilityÂ from reading about Paul Miller from the Verge's experiment where he completely <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet">unplugged from the internet for a year</a>. Â While my reasons wereÂ simplerÂ than Paul's I cameÂ acrossÂ <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/05/03/quitting-the-internet-is-a-dumb-idea">another article</a>Â (that I don't agree with 100%) that gave me further insight into my problems and a few things that I can do to further gain razor like focus.

Last Saturday I turned off my cellphones, unplugged my Apple TV and made sure that I had created a vacation reply to let people know that I'm taking an internet day off. From there myÂ SaturdayÂ was pretty normal. I began by going to my boys soccer games then I did a few things around the house to keep myself busy. I didn't feel anyÂ withdrawalsÂ or even the urge to go online. I simply didn't. I didn't feel any type of revelation or haha moment. I simply realized that I didn't need to be on the internet.

My next phase is going to be unplugging daily. From 9 - 10 p.m I plan on completely unplugging from the internet to read a book. I have a large stack of paper back books about code that I've neglected. I plan on reading them before I go to bed to see if this will effect my focus.

While this post didn't provide anything enlightening or revolutionary I feel as though it's my first step into having a healthy balance of online offline life.";s:10:"post_title";s:32:"Unplugged and my lessons learned";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:32:"unplugged-and-my-lessons-learned";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-11-08 02:37:21";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-11-08 02:37:21";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=451";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
