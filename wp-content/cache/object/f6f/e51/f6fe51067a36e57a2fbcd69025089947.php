Everyone from the CEO of Facebook to the President of the United States is saying that we need to teach our children to code. Within the last few years Bootcamps have risen that give you a 2-3 month course into getting you employed into the career of Coding. Computers, cellphones and even tablets have matured while we are starting to see smartwatches. Someone needs to code for those things right? Why wouldn't you want your children to get into the new career hotness?
<h3>Let Me Set The Stage So You Understand My Position</h3>
I'm 36 years old. I have 3 children. I am self-taught and have worked in a number of languages/frameworks. When I decided to get into web development there was no iPhone. TDD what. Scrum who? I remember when there was no SEO. At that time I felt as though I could change the world. I felt as though the internet was a good thing for society and humankind. Fast forward 15 years. Everything has changed.

The heart of the change is zero industry standards or guidance for a successful career. What language should you pick? How do you know if you're a jr., mid level or senior developer. What path should you take? Where should you live? How much money am I worth? Can I retire doing this?
<h3>What Comes Next Is My Personal Opinion</h3>
99% of the companies today don't care about you. When my father was in tech years ago it was the other way around. My father told me a story on how he got a job (at 100k) because he heard of Fortran. Not because he did anything with it. Just because he knew what it was. This was in the 80's. In 2016 developers on average make around 100k. The top tech firms in Silicon Valley just settled a multi million dollar lawsuit because they made a secret pact to not hire away developers to keep the salary cost down. Google and Apple were among these companies. These are companies that make billions in profit per quarter. A quarter is months and not a full year.

If a company could replace you with someone in another country for less pay they will. When I look at job requirements nowadays the expectations are unrealistic. They want a Jr. developer with 3 years of experience. You should know 3 front end technologies, 5 back end and work with 3 different databases while doing system admin work, IT and testing. They want you to hold 5 different disciplines while not paying for those 5 different disciplines. The new hotness is full stack developer. Which means they want you to do everything for the same pay as a back end developer (1 discipline) made 5 years ago.

Or the running joke is saying something like we want 15 years of Ruby on Rails experience (Rails is only 10 years old). Companies do that so that they can hire someone cheaper than you. Because in order to get a worker from another country you have to say that no one in the US can fill this job. Job security has gone out the window. In this ever changing landscape you're lucky if your job is still around in 5 years.

The salary of the middle class in America is $250,000. Name one developer that works for a company that makes that. Why shouldn't we. The frickin President of the United States says we should all learn how to code and that there's a shortage of talent. No Mr. President there's no shortage of talent it's just the expectations are unrealistic. Companies want you to sacrifice your soul to this profession. I walked out on the final round of a Google interview because they expected me to sleep at work. Yeah sleep there. They have sleeping pods because they don't want you to leave. Screw that. Same thing went for Apple. They have meetings at midnight and expect you to be there. Sorry but nope.

The whole teach everyone to code is a ploy to lower the salaries of existing developers. Basic supply and demand. More developers = less pay. Simple Math. Major tech companies (primarily Facebook or Marc Zuckerberg) pushed that advertising campaign hard. If they cared so much about teaching people in the US to code why don't they do something about it. I live in Southern California. Facebook, Google and Apple are an 8 hour drive from here. The teachers at my children's school ask for donations to buy paper. Fucking paper.

I want my kids to be happy. I don't want them to work to live. I don't want my children to worry that if spending X number of years on this framework is a bad choice. I want my children to make enough money to support their families where their pay increases with the cost of living in the United States. I don't want my children to do what I do for a living.

I still love what I do and wouldn't trade it for anything but I don't want my children to follow in my footsteps. Because in the next 10 years I see us all doing full stack development with Html. In 10-20 years building a website will be the new Fast Food job. Getting a job to support a family will have more to do with luck than skill.

You may disagree with everything I've written. My answer is that I don't care. If I did I would have comments. This blog is kinda like my personal journal for my family and friends. This post has been sitting there in the back of my head wanting to get out. It wasn't until a few days ago I realized I needed to get this on my blog for my children and for the countless people that ask me about this career path.";s:10:"post_title";s:28:"I Don't Want My Kids To Code";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:5:"draft";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:19:"dont-want-kids-code";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-08-13 16:17:04";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-08-13 16:17:04";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=879";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
