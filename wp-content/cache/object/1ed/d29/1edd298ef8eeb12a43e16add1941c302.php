I feel as though I've wasted 2 weeks with the different platforms out there to only settle on the wrong one. I should have known the cloud is going to fuck me. It did. Thank god I didn't trust actual production apps to the cloud.

Now just like everything else that've I've posted from the hip (and have later changed my mind) I don't consider this post to be my final verdict on developing in the cloud. It's just my stance right now.

Cloud9 sucked yesterday. Everything was slow. It took me 2 hours to get a Laravel install going. At first I was going to go with Phalcon PHP but decided that after reading what seemed to be outdated docs that I might as well stick with Laravel this go around for a personal project that I'm working on.

Cloud9 was by far the most feature packed possible replacement but the slowness killed it. Then I looked at my project just a few minutes ago and guess what? It's gone. Don't know why or how but the project that I spent 2 hours of pain and sweat on is now gone. Thank god for git. So I pulled my app from bitbucket into my mac and started coding away within less than 5 minutes.

So for right now fuck the cloud for development.";s:10:"post_title";s:31:"Screw The Cloud For Development";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:22:"fuck-cloud-development";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-04-07 03:54:52";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-04-07 03:54:52";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=644";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
