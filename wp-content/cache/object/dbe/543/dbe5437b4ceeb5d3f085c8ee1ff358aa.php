Some initial benchmarks were released and it appears the Exynos chip is not close to the new haswell chips some of the chromebooks have been using (such as the Toshiba &amp; HP 14 chromebooks).

It looks like Samsung was <a title="Chrome OS is Almost There" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2014/03/chrome-os-almost/">listening to me</a> (wink wink) and released 2 new chromebook models. One 11 inch and the other 13.something inches. While those screen sizes have existed before the resolution ofÂ 1,920x1,080 for a reasonably priced chromebook hasn't. The specs are pretty impressive with 4 gb or ram, some newÂ Exynos chip that boasts over 8 hours and the new fo leather stitching that match <a title="My New Love The Note 3" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2014/02/new-love-note-3/">my note 3</a>. The 11 something inch was around $319 while the one that I want, the 13 incher was $399. I will be getting this laptop the day that it's released.
