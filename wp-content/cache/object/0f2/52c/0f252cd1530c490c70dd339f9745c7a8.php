They have released not one but 3 new gear devices while dropping the Galaxy name. The Gear 2, Gear Neo and the Gear fit. The Gear 2 includes a camera, while the Gear 2 Neo doesn't and the Gear fit has a curved display. All 3 devices run Tizen vs. Android and claim better battery life, faster speeds due to the updated processor and more features. What's really interesting about the whole ordeal is that they released an sdk so that developers can develop for the platform.

I would be a liar if I said that I didn't want the Galaxy Gear. I've patiently waited for the price to come down and right when I was going to push the buy button, bam Samsung confirms the Galaxy Gear 2. Why do I want the Galaxy Gear? Because I do. So there. the mk7 update that allowed you to view gmail messages on the phone sealed the deal pretty much and honestly as a gen 1 device (from Samsung of all places) I was convinced that it was right for me. Hopefully by the end of the month we'll get some leaks or even maybe the official announcement.
