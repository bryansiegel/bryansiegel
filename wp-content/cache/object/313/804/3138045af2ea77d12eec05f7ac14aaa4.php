Which started out fine, 2-3 and sometimes even more posts per month but in July everything stopped. In an effort to be a cheap ass I decided to get rid of my web host. Boy was that a mistake. In a series of events and multiple failed backups I have finally gotten my website back in order. For about a month I lost 2 years of posts and nearly all of my pictures and felt zero need or passion to post anything because of that loss. But luckily Mavericks happened. My Mavericks update made my Macbook pro run like shit, so I decided to use my backup to do a clean install of Mavericks in which I found a good backup of my site <a href="http://bryansiegel.com">bryansiegel.com</a>. Now I'm back and ready to get back to posting full time.";s:10:"post_title";s:46:"Almost 4 months of no posts on bryansiegel.com";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:46:"almost-4-months-of-no-posts-on-bryansiegel-com";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-11-08 02:37:21";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-11-08 02:37:21";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=538";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
