One thing I loved about Rails was how modular it felt. If you need an admin use Active Admin, which is simply including the gem within your gem file a rake command or two then your set with a professional looking administration backend for your project. The thing is if you're working on a quick project such as a CMS and you need to host it on the cheap Rails isn't the best option (for me). While I love developing in Rails my biggest frustration has always been deployment. I know there's Heroku and other options out there but nothing comes close to PHP's ease of hosting and the choice of frameworks that you can use.
