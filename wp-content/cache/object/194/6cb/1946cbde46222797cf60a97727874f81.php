July 1st of 2013 is when Google is getting rid of Google Reader. Since 2005 I've used Google reader daily to get my news fix. While many say that it's no surprise the service is going away, I have to say that the loss of my favorite app has surprised me. I went through the same thing with Google Listen (their dedicated podcasting app on Android) and the recent loss of Google Reader is making me think twice about relying on solely on Google services. I'm not going to do anything crazy like delete my Google account but the though has crossed my mind on occasion. Well it was great while it lasted. Goodbye Google Reader. I will miss you.";s:10:"post_title";s:19:"R.I.P Google Reader";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:19:"r-i-p-google-reader";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-11-08 02:37:22";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-11-08 02:37:22";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=325";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
