Oh Macbook air you were great while you lasted. We had allot of fun together but I've realized it's me, not you. You see I have this CR-48 that runs Ubuntu. My battery lasts atleast 8 hours and it's really fast. While I can't watch Netflix on my CR-48 my battery lasts 8 hours and I'm not distracted by Netflix. You see I can't own a laptop that lasts 4 hours because I tend to get 2 if I watch Netflix, and if I watch Netflix I don't get any coding done. If I don't code I feel guilty and drink. In the short term I may be fine but a few years down the line my Macbook air might turn me into an alcoholic. So I gave you back to Apple who has a shitty return policy when you bought something in cash (I had to wait 2 weeks to get my cash), but that's okay it's Apple, they do nothing wrong (gag). Goodbye my friend the next time I see you I hope that you give me at least 8 hours of battery life.
