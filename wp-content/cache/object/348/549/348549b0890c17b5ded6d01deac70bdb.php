But I couldn't use IOS 7. It gave me a headache. I hated the white everywhere backgrounds and worse were the transitions. While I agree that IOS needed a facelift, that facelift didn't work for me. I truly wish Apple luck with their future IOS endeavors but this is the end of the line for me and the iPhone. I've had every major model of iPhone, while jailbroken on T-Mobile and finally with a legit version when the iPhone 5 came out.
