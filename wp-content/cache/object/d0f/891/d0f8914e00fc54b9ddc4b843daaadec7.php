I hated the frequent crashes, horrible interface and crappy touchscreen. The g1 came out and my wife bought the phone first. The g1 did not have the features that i wanted in a cellphone at the time.

Then Google released Google listen. I am a podcast addict. While I loved my Ipod I did not like lugging around two different devices in my pocket. I decided to invest in Android.

I have to say that I was happy with my g1 until newer phones like the droid and Nexus One. Now I am second guessing my decision due to the fact I may not be able to update my phone to the latest release of Android. If my G1 doesn`t update by the end of 2010 I`ll have to switch to the Iphone.

If it wasn't for the fact that Iphones drop calls I would have made the switch, because I have lost confidence in Android. I went through this crap with Windows mobile where I could not download the latest release and I will not do it again.";s:10:"post_title";s:26:"4 months with the g1 phone";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:26:"4-months-with-the-g1-phone";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-04-25 04:38:59";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-04-25 04:38:59";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:28:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=38";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
