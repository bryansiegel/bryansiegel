It's hard to ignore Apple's Itunes and Microsoft's Zune software but I'm sick and tired of plugging my phone into a computer. I carry a Mytouch 4g &amp; Iphone 4 (provided by work) and tend to use the Mytouch 4g more often because I don't have to plug it into the computer for podcasts. I have a large collection of music that won't fit onto my cellphone and have to say that <a title="Google Music Beta" href="http://music.google.com/about/">Google Music</a> is what I've been looking for for a long time. I've used Pandora and all of the streaming music offerings but I'm not really into finding new music I like the crap that I have. Google Music will let you upload 25,000 songs -- yes I said 25,000 songs for free while the service is in beta. Don't take my word for it check out the video for more info on this kick ass service.
