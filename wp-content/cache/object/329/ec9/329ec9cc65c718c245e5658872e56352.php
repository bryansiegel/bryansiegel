Like other dream filled days of my life I had one such idea today. Half-jokingly I suggested skid mark proof underwear. While the idea was still in Alpha stage I was convinced my idea was truly original. Come on, skid mark proof underwear who would ever come up with a genius idea like that.

Well... I wasn't the only one with the idea a company called garmentguard (which specializes in underarm sweat protection) has a skid guard called Skid out. While my idea of being the original skid mark guard faded I decided to take this idea and turn it into a few laughs.

While searching around I found another invention (that involved underwear) called security briefs which store your personal belongings in underwear instead of a safe.

How genious!!!

Now is it just me or do all of these underwear inventions use tiddy whities on their website?
