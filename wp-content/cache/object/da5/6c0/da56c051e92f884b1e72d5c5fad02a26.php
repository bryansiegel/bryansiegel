This is by far the best phone I've ever used. From the big screen, camera and IR blaster (yes IR blaster), this phone kicks ass. I won a Nexus 5 last month too and I couldn't bring myself to use it full time. Why? Well because once you go big you can't go back. The funny thing is when I first got the Note 3 I wanted to take it back because it was too big, but I told myself that I should just get used to it and give it a shot. Boy am I glad that I made that decision. This phone is not only fast but it has totally eliminated my use for a remote. For those of you with kids you'll probably relate. I can never find my remotes. I have 3. One for the T.V., DVR and Google TV. The IR in my phone has eliminated all of those remotes. The other thing I love is the batter life. I get well over a day of use. I use this phone pretty hard and I can't seem to drain the battery in a day. The last thing that put this phone over the top is the micro sd card slot. I got a 32 gb card to hold all of my web dev tutorial videos and comics and still have a crap load of room to spare. So if you're in the market for a phone and the Note 3's size is holding you back I would recommend that you give it a true shot. It'll take a few weeks but once you do you'll never be able to go back to a smaller screen.";s:10:"post_title";s:22:"My New Love The Note 3";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:15:"new-love-note-3";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-02-02 21:40:58";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-02-02 21:40:58";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=595";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
