This is the <a href="/2011/10/09/bryansiegel-coms-new-design/" title="Bryansiegel.com new design">third time</a> I've updated my blog platform and millionth time I've switched hosts. I've had this blog since 2007. For reasons unknown I haven't deleted it. I rarely update it and I don't add anything substantial to it. This blog is like that old blanket that smells and it's ripped but you hang onto it because you've had it so long. 

The reason why I updated the site was really because it was hacked. Yeah I know me hacked (hey it can happen to anyone). Truth be told I updated it regularly and added the recommended Wordpress security plugins and it was still compromised. I blame wordpress for that one. Anyway I decided to go with something less popular and non PHP. I ended up with <a href="http://octopress.org" title="Octopress">Octopress</a> and had a few hiccups setting it up but so far so good. I'm using Ruby on Rails and went with <a href="http://railsplayground.com/" title="Railsplayground">Railsplayground</a> for hosting. I plan on writing a guide on how to set this up and my workflow later. 

By no means is the design final. There's allot that I plan on doing but I've spent hours updating this thing and getting it hosted. I need a break.
