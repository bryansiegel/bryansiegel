<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Have you ever had a million dollar idea you swear no one has come up with. Like other dream filled days of my life I had one such idea today. Half-jokingly I suggested skid mark proof underwear. While the idea was still in Alpha stage I was convinced my idea was truly original. Come on, skid mark proof underwear who would ever come up with a genius idea like that.<br/><br/>Well... I wasn't the only one with the idea a company called garmentguard (which specializes in underarm sweat protection) has a <a href='http://www.garmentguard.com/index.asp' target='_blank'>skid guard</a> called Skid out. While my idea of being the original skid mark guard faded I decided to take this idea and turn it into a few laughs. <br/><br/>While searching around I found another invention (that involved underwear) called <a href='http://www.asseenontvguys.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=344' target='_blank'>security briefs</a> which store your personal belongings in underwear instead of a safe. <br/><br/>How genious!!!<br/><br/>Now is it just me or do all of these underwear inventions use tiddy whities on their website?<br/><br/><br/></div>
