I'm not going to attempt to discuss the privacy mess that happened with Carrier IQ if you want to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/5/2609662/carrier-iq-interview">read an interview</a> with the head of marketing from Carier IQ . I'm not really that bothered because I root my Android phones, I have an Iphone 4 on IOS 5 on Verizon. If you were following the news Verizon wasn't a Carrier IQ customer. I bet Verizon has their own system written without frameworks and all custom code. I would love to see that code. Anyway I wanted to list the T-Mobile phones that have Carrier IQ installed because I'm a T-mobile USA customer.
