Tonight Google and Samsung unveiled their newest creation the <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/">Galaxy Nexus</a>. While impressed with the offering there's a few questions that I have regarding the device such as where is the menu button and the battery life. According to This is my Next the Galaxy Nexus <a href="http://thisismynext.com/2011/10/18/galaxy-nexus-android-ice-cream-sandwich-pictures-video-hands-on/">seemed laggy</a>.

It's still too early for me to decide whether I'm still going with the <a href="/2011/10/14/is-a-windows-phone-right-for-me/">HTC Titan</a> if it's ever released to T-Mobile or whether I'm buying the Galaxy Nexus.

Decisions.
