I started my blog in 2007. Fast forward to 2011 and I've posted irregularly and about different crap that I find amusing but for some reason people keep reading this crap. I've topped 5,000 daily unique visitor's and decided it's time for a change. Why did it take me so long, I don't have a clue but I decided it was time to roll up the sleeves and get working on a new design. Well, here's the new design. I hope that you like it. It's a continued work in progress while I iron out a few of the design ascetics and add/remove plugins. I decided to go with Wordpress and that it was time to own my own content (I was previously on Blogger and your content is on Google's servers).</p>

<h3>Converting Blogger to Wordpress was easy</h3>

<p>One of the reasons it took me so long to make the change is that I dreaded changing one blog platform to another. I was surprised to find that exporting Blogger posts to Wordpress was a breeze but I did run into a minor quirk; the url's still linked to the old blogger url's. Besides that, everything from the posts, tags and even the images imported into Wordpress without a problem</a>
