Since we had kids (and the fact the landlord only wanted to fork out money to put bleach on it) we decided to find another place to live. Since I know the web like the back of my hand I decided to search craigslist for rentals in my area. I found allot of good deals and emailed a few, but I recieved a response to one of them that is obviously a scam. <br/><br/><b>Disclaimer: I do not know 100% whether or not this is definately a scam, but I will try to contact the homeowner and alert the athorities</b><br/><br/>Okay with all the legal stuff out of the way here is the message,<br/><br/><h3>Craigslist homes for rent scam email</h3><br/><br/><i>"Hello Dear,<br/> <br/>Thanks for the email. I own the House and also want you to know that it was due to my transfer to (West Africa, Nigeria) that makes us to leave the House and also want to give it out for rent and looking for a responsible person and God fearing person who can take very good care of the house in our absence.we are not after the money for the rent but want it to be clean all the time and the person that will rent it to take it as if it were its own. So for now, We are here in West Africa and will be staying here for the next 4 years in our new House and also with the keys of the House for rent, we try to look for an agent that we can give this documents and the keys before we left but could not find, and we as well  do not want our House to be used any how in our absence that is why we took it along with us. I and my Wife came over to Africa for a missionary work, so i hope you will promise us that you will  take very good care of the house. So get back to me if you know you could take care of our house or perhaps experience you have in renting home. Hope you are okay with the price of $1000 per month and the security Deposit is $400.Get back to me for the rental application.You can go and view."</i><br/><br/>Beware of craigslist scams!!! Especially if anyone is living in another country and the price is too good to be true.
