Even my friend who has a <a href="http://zaknicola.wordpress.com/2007/12/14/bryan-siegels-life-uncut/">hypnotizing Smile</a> admits it (sorta) in his post about me. I've include a pic of my desktop to show the world that "I'm geek and damb proud of it"! From my collection of Star Trek icons to my Star ship Enterprise Desktop image I have no problem with flaunting my geekiness.<br /><br />Okay I'm a little over the top but who isn't? I'm flexing my muscles just like Arnold Schwarzenegger did in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator">The Terminator films</a>. What people don't know is that there is a secret order of Geeks. There are rules to this order.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Geek Rule Number 1</span><br /><br />You must have seen all Star Wars Films and own at least one <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS243US243&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=lightsaber&amp;spell=1" class="p"><b><i>lightsaber</i></b></a>  .<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Geek Rule Numero dos</span><br /><br />You must like science fiction movies and believe that someday an alien will abduct you.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rule three is....</span><br /><br />You must play video games more often than you work out (yeah right geeks don't work out)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">4</span><br /><br />If most people don't understand a word you are saying when you speak you're a geek (or have a bad mumbling problem)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">You guessed it this is rule 5 and I'll make this the last rule for now</span><br /><br />You must have had a hidden crush on <a href="http://starwars.ugo.com/images/girls/starwars_carriefisher/starwars_carriefisher_3.jpg">Princess Leia </a>one time or another.<br /><br />And there you have it. If you can follow these 5 rules consider yourself part of the underground Geek club.
