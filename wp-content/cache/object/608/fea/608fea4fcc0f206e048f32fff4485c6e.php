It's May 2012 and the projects keep coming in. While I had a few months of heavy Asp.net web development I've been focused on more PHP projects and a few Ruby on Rails projects.

My Twitter account has been <a title="Bryan Siegel on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/BryanSiegel" target="_blank">left abandoned</a> since January 6th andÂ <a title="Bryan Siegel" href="https://plus.google.com/107021327353878189947/posts" target="_blank">Google+</a>Â since December 31st. Santa got me a <a title="Lenovo 120e kicks ass" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb-ns5f2dV4" target="_blank">Lenovo 120e</a>Â and Bryan's selfish self bought an 8gb ram upgrade and ssd. I'm rocking Visual Studio 2010 the pro edition with Git (thanks Ruby on Rails), and a <a title="WekeRoad Ink theme for Visual Studio" href="http://studiostyl.es/schemes/wekeroad-ink" target="_blank">custom color theme</a> because it's easier on my eyes and frankly looks cool.

The last 2 years I cut back on Asp.net (I still worked on projects) and primarily focused on Ruby on Rails and some PHP. 2011 was the year of e-commerce, blogs, a CMS and a whole lot of E-Commerce SEO and PPC. 2012 is looking like an even crazier year with bigger and better projects.

<strong>Where do you find the time?</strong>

My hobby is learning as much about the Internet as I can. I love code, Internet Marketing comes natural and frankly I'm aÂ geniusÂ with time management. You see... Star Trek has had a major influence on me. If you've never seen Star Trek the next generation I highly recommend that you watchÂ at leastÂ the last 4 episodes of the 7th season. In the Star Trek Universe one of the messages that the show conveys is that humans constantly strive to better themselves. You see I have a fond memory of my father reading books about becoming a better person. You know those books that teach you confidence and the other load of crap those 5 dolloar books at the gas station sell you. I guess bettering myself has roots from my fathers genes and Star Trek just kicked them into gear is the way I interpret it.

<strong>Back to the reason behind the post</strong>

I've already stretched myself thin. It's Friday night at 2:30 a.m (I'm completely sober man). I decided to take a break on the back end of an Asp.net 4.0 application that is beyond anything I accomplished last year. Before I <a title="Thanks Ben. I never thought of that" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dtkwfdky.aspx" target="_blank">encrypt my Web.config file</a>Â I decided to take a break and write a quick post with my usual taste of bad grammar and geek.

I'm going to be busy for awhile.
