As the Internet gets smarter and Internet speeds get faster my web experience is getting a whole lot better. I remember dial up speeds and the bright colors of Internets past. I remember the first time I saw YouTube and thinking to myself, "this is where things are going to lead." Successful websites are all about the experience and ease of use. There are 2 video websites I visit, when I need a break..<br /><br /><a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/">FunnyOrDie.com</a> is hands down the great idea of the year. A social funny video site mixed in with a YouTube embed feature leaves me to wonder how long YouTube will stay ahead of the video game. Check Will Ferrell in the most funniest video I've seen on the site so far;<br /><br /><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="300" height="388"><param name="movie" value="http://www2.funnyordie.com/public/flash/fodplayer.swf?af2c813e"><param name="flashvars" value="key=74"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><embed flashvars="key=74" allowfullscreen="true" quality="high" src="http://www2.funnyordie.com/public/flash/fodplayer.swf?af2c813e" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="300" height="388"></embed></object><div style="text-align: center; width: 300px;">See more <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/will_ferrell">Will Ferrell</a> videos at Funny or Die</div><br /><br />Hulu.com - Is the <a href="http://hulu.com/">legal way of watching T.V. shows and movies</a>.
