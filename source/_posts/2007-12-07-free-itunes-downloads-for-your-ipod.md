Ever since my Ipod came in my life it has become an essential part of my everyday life. It helps with when I'm stuck in<a title="Fuck Irvine" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2007/12/california-traffic/"> California traffic</a>, sitting for hours at the DMV or taking a dump (you know that you do too). At first I downloaded all my music on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/">iPod</a> and noticed that I used only a fraction of the honking 160 GB of memory. For those of you who are not computer literate 160 gigs equals to allot of room for crap.

Feelling like a kid again I went to <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes</a> and downloaded a couple of Star Trek Movies and noticed that I still had allot of room left. At that exact moment I thought to myselft; I have unlimited memory I can download everything just about everything (alright I admit there was beer envolved when I thought of that).

That's when I got into <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">FREE iTunes podcast downloads</a>! Here is a list of my top downloads feel free to <span style="font-weight: bold;">share yours</span>.

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 130%;"><a href="http://geekson.com/">Geekson.com</a></span>
<span class="style1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Geeks on was my first podcast. Aaron Hendricks, Matt King, Peter Robinson and Uber Geek Don Marshall though different in their own ways fullfill my inner Geek. They talk about an array of topics ranging from Star Trek to Geeks news. After the first episode I was hooked. The <a href="http://geekson.com/contactus.htm">guys over at Geeks on</a> </span></span>definately are worth the listen.

</span>Darker Projects is a site dedicated to a darker side of audio drama. For the past year I have been captivated by all of their original stories. Eric Busby and his band of talent have put me on the edge of my seat many times along with a few nightmares (okay I'm a wuss). Here are the current masterpieces Darker Projects has in their arsenal. My personal favorites are the Star Trek serious (because I'm a die hard fan) and The Byron Chronicles.

<span style="font-size: 130%;"><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://xmone.libsyn.com/">X Minus One</a>
</span>X Minus One is an old time Scifi program I enjoy. I believe it's a rebroadcast of a show that was on ABC back in the early to late 50's. Great acting, awesome sound effects and original plots.
