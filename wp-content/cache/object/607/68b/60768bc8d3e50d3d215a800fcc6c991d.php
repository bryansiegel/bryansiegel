Microsoft doesn't make the learning development easy (even though they have thousands of pages on their msdn.microsoft.com site). In order for me to understand what the heck I was looking for I decided that maybe listening to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">podcasts</span> over and over again was the answer. I listened vigorously to all I had and settled with a few.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx">.Net Rocks</a> - is a  weekly podcast hosted by Carl Franklin and Richard <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Cambell</span>. Their podcast helped me find out if I wanted to be a web developer in the first place. After a few shows I got hooked and have been listening to them ever since.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Hanselminutes</span></a> - is hosted by Scott <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Hanselman</span> is  a .net guy and technology buff. His shows range from asp.net to <a href="http://silverlight.net/"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">silverlight</span></a>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">ajax</span> and all web technologies. This guy has my dream job of working for Microsoft and from his <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/about.aspx">about page</a> he's a pretty smart guy.<br /><br />Both <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">podcasts</span> are great, but I learn better by example which brings me to another one of Carl Franklin's sites <a href="http://www.dnrtv.com/"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">dnrtv</span>.com</a>. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">dnr</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">tv</span> is a good way of seeing code in action. It's not really a place for beginners, but if you want to understand why .net is scalable and the technologies surrounding it, I recommend that you head in head first.<br /><br />On a side note I've updated my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bsiegel"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">linkedin</span> profile to include asp.net and c#</a>. I've added a few to my list, but I'm not interested in forging connections with people I never met because I used to work with them. This is rude, but I've never been a popular person nor do I wish to be.<br /><br /><h3>Prepare yourself for a side of ranting</h3>I've not been in touch with my blog lately. I haven't forgotten about it but you all know I've been doing the whole .net gig and I'm finally getting a grasp on it, coding and developing applications on my own web server. I've noticed people are following me on Twitter and contacting me through social websites such as <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">facebook</span>. I don't have time for those sites, but I would still like to keep in contact with people I used to talk to. Instead of me going to some website and logging in why don't you <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">IM</span> me at seosiegel@aol.com or you can email me at bryansiegel@gmail.com.
