I've always used Google as my primary search engine because it just worked and I trusted the results. But after using Duck Duck Go as my primary search engine I can honestly say that so far, Duck Duck Go provides me with better results.

My favorite feature of Duck Duck Go is the dark theme.

My second is the more results link on each result. This works really well for searching for things such as Php functions.

You get a list of results similar to your query from the same website.

A search for my favorite burger place Iron Burger provides me with Yelp reviews

One thing Duck Duck Go solves nicely is saving your preferences by using a feature called cloud save. So instead of a login I can use a passphrase to save everything which is super nice.

These are the things I've used so far. There are other features such as the bang feature that I haven't used yet but as I become more comfortable with Duck Duck Go I can see myself using those features regularly.

One questions that I ask regularly is why Apple hasn't bought Duck Duck Go. Their stance on privacy align with Apple's and I feel if Apple sync's Duck Duck Go's results within Siri, Google is in serious trouble. I guess only time will tell.

My overall verdict is so far so good. I'm enjoying using Duck Duck Go as my primary search engine.";s:10:"post_title";s:31:"My First Week With Duck Duck Go";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:31:"my-first-week-with-duck-duck-go";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-11-16 13:41:05";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-11-16 13:41:05";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=803";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
