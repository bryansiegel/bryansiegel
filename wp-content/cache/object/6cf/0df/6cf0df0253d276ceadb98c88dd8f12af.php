I'm not a fan of Mac OSX, I <a title="WTF Ubuntu" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2011/04/wtf-ubuntu/">threw in the towel on Linux</a> (primarily Ubuntu and Mint)(and yes I know that Chrome OS runs on Linux) and Windows is a nightmare because of the constant threats and hackery that I have to go through to get a dev box going. That's where Chrome OS comes in. I was a proud owner of the <a title="Final Thoughts on the cr-48 &amp; Chrome OS" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2011/03/final-thoughts-on-the-cr-48-chrome-os/">CR48</a> from Google in the early stages of the OS. While fun to try it didn't get the job done for me at the time. Fast forward a few years and there's all types of online IDE's to code in from ones that edit your local files to full on dev environments in the cloud. So I decided to give it a try and to give some of the IDE's a try. I was not blown away but they've come a very long day since Chrome OS was launched. It's workable. I'll have to re train a few things that <a title="Text Editors Are Cool But I Use an IDE To Get Shit Done" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2013/03/text-editors-are-cool-but-i-use-an-ide-to-get-shit-done/">I've come accustomed to</a> but I think it's time for me to release my technical debt and give the cloud a shot. Why. I'm writing this blog post on a 5,000 dollar macbook pro (my backup machine for my X1 that was puked on) with all of the bells and whistles, but I'm in a rush because my battery is almost dead. This machine used to get 7 hours give or take and now I'm lucky to get 3. 3 hours on a charge sucks and this machine is not even a year old. To replace it I would have to spend a small fortune again. I'm not falling for that trap anymore. Not to mention the updates and maintenance involved takes the little bit of time that I have left. As my children grow I've noticed my free time is almost a thing of the past. We have soccer, dance, scouts and school functions that pretty much kill my after hours coding sessions (on top of a second job). A few weeks ago I wanted to get up and going with angular and didn't even get to write a single line of code because I was too busy getting my dev environment up.

Maybe it's my age but <a title="Unplugged and my lessons learned" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2013/05/unplugged-and-my-lessons-learned/">I don't want to tinker around</a> with my computer in order to code anymore. I used to love it. Windows re installs were a weekly thing for me back in the day but I'm not feeling it anymore.

Chromebooks go for around 300 bucks. My mac was 5 grand. My X1 was 2 grand. I could buy a crapload of chromebooks for the price of anyone of those other machines. While there are some pluses to owning a chromebook I'm faced with a few minus as well. Like the IDE. Everyone is getting hacked nowadays. Do I trust my code behind a username and password? I know that I do that currently with Bitbucket but I don't store server credentials in there. In the cloud I might have to. Another thing that I'm researching is what happens if the Chrome app project dies? Or if someone spam/malicious company buys the IDE that I use and turns it into a malware hub? While I've researched some of the security behind Chrome OS and sandboxing I haven't been able to sort out those two issues yet.

While I <a title="The Samsung Chromebook 2 was Announced" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2014/03/samsung-chromebook-2-announced/">wait for Samsungs Chromebook 2</a>Â (the 13 inch model with the better resolution) for atleast another month, I'll continue my research because I don't want to be stuck with a 400 dollar paperweight or do <a title="How my Cr-48 running Ubuntu 11.04 ruined my Macbook's life" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2011/05/how-my-cr-48-running-ubuntu-11-04-ruined-my-macbooks-life/">what I did with the CR48</a>Â and put linux on it. Maybe for once I'll be satisfied with OS. Or not who knows, but I'm kinda excited about Chrome OS.";s:10:"post_title";s:21:"Tech Debt & The Cloud";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:15:"tech-debt-cloud";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-03-08 05:37:05";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-03-08 05:37:05";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=624";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
