Windows 8 is a no go and I can't stand Mac OSX. While I've written about how my <a title="My Trucks Are Turning Into Hybrids" href="http://bryansiegel.com/2013/12/trucks-turning-hybrids/">trucks are turning into hybrids</a> but maybe I don't need a truck anymore. Chrome OS has come a very long way and is almost there. I've been playing with Chrome OS and I have to say that it's almost there. You can have a <a href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/wiki/LAMP-on-ChromeOS-Cookbook">Lamp environment in Chrome OS</a>. There are text editors such as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml?hl=en">Caret</a>Â and an <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">easy way to switch to linux</a> incase Chrome doesn't have the app that you need (like FTP). The one thing that is holding me back is the hardware available. A 1366x768 resolution screen won't cut it and there's no way in hell I'm dropping $1,300 for a Chromebook Pixel, but there's been a few leaks of new Samsung Chromebook hardware coming soon so I'll hold out for that. Once I get my hands on some hardware I'll give it a real try to see if Chrome OS is right for me.";s:10:"post_title";s:25:"Chrome OS is Almost There";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:16:"chrome-os-almost";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-03-02 17:56:27";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-03-02 17:56:27";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://bryansiegel.com/?p=610";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
